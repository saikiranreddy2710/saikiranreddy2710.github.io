# saikiranreddy2710.github.io

Personal portfolio (GitHub Pages). Includes:
- Liquid glass design (glasmorphism) and animated background blobs
- Smooth parallax on scroll and pointer
- Reveal-on-scroll animations and magnetic buttons
- Light/dark theme toggle (click ðŸŒ— or press "t")

## Preview locally

You can open `index.html` directly in the browser, or serve a local server to test scroll and routing behavior:

```bash
# Python (any)
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

Accessibility: respects `prefers-reduced-motion` to reduce animations.
